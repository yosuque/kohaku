Production adapters: `@kohaku-ui/storage-redis` and `@kohaku-ui/storage-postgres` implement the whole `StoragePort` (Spec cache, lineage, promotion state, fixation, tenant scoping) so several host instances share one Spec cache and serve the same Intent as `cache: "hit"`; `@kohaku-ui/authz-jwt` resolves principal / roles / tenant from JWT / OIDC claims (shared secret or JWKS) and delegates capability tokens to `@kohaku-ui/authz-hmac`. All three are reference adapters over the unchanged `ports.ts` contract; the sample host selects them via `KOHAKU_STORAGE` / `KOHAKU_AUTHZ`.
