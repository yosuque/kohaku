Compliance Evidence Pack (design.md decision 67): `verifyEvidencePack` now checks the signature over the raw `manifest.json` value before validating its shape, so a field added, removed or retyped after signing no longer verifies (the manifest schemas are strict and have no defaults, and the Python port matches). `buildEvidencePack` refuses to emit a file larger than the 64 MiB cap that verification enforces (new `maxFileBytes` option), instead of producing a pack that cannot be verified, and reports unparseable lines inside signed jsonl content.
