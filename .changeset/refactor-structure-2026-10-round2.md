Structural refactoring, round two (behavior-preserving):

- `@kohaku-ui/host/mcp-http` (new subpath): `createMcpHttpServer`, the Streamable-HTTP scaffold (Host/Origin guards, echoed-Origin CORS, OPTIONS preflight, size-capped body pre-read, stateless `createMcpHandler` wiring) that `apps/sample-mcp` used to carry inline. `@modelcontextprotocol/node` becomes an optional peer dependency, needed only for this subpath. Defaults follow the server `kohaku init --mcp` generates; every place the sample answers differently is an explicit option. The init template itself still carries its own copy and switches after this release.
- `@kohaku-ui/host-core`: `buildActionManifestSafely` and `recordComposedAndFallback`, the order-neutral delivery helpers both host profiles now call (each host keeps its own step order and `onError` endpoint names; characterization tests pin them).
- `@kohaku-ui/spec-core`: `src/ports.ts` is now a barrel over one file per Port under `src/ports/` (plus `theme-tokens.ts`); every exported name and import path is unchanged.
- `@kohaku-ui/host-rest`: the compose pipeline helpers (capability issuance, fixation host) live in `routes/compose-pipeline.ts`.
- `@kohaku-ui/cli`: one registration module per command under `cli/src/cli/`, result printers next to their runners as `format*` functions; `--help` output and exit codes are unchanged (pinned by a help snapshot test).
