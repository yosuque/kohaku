### Patch Changes

- [#64](https://github.com/yosuque/kohaku/pull/64) [`b712fef`](https://github.com/yosuque/kohaku/commit/b712fef7404c6af1ca6ff726890eb6ddfd44dbfc) Thanks [@yosuque](https://github.com/yosuque)! - `POST /approvals` no longer reports every `issueApproval` failure as a 400 with the raw message: only an `ApprovalIssueError` (or an error carrying `code: "APPROVAL_ISSUE_REJECTED"`, both new in spec-core; `createHmacApprovalPort` throws it for a self-approval) maps to 400, and any other error is reported to `onError` and returned as a fixed-text 500 `INTERNAL` (design.md decision 63). `createHmacApprovalPort` also gains `maxTtlSeconds` (default 3600) that clamps every granted lifetime, so a caller-supplied `ttlSeconds` up to 86400 no longer yields a day-long replay window when no `ApprovalStore` is configured.

- [#64](https://github.com/yosuque/kohaku/pull/64) [`5298e29`](https://github.com/yosuque/kohaku/commit/5298e299c010b6c7b088d9c778f3856a8b96e941) Thanks [@yosuque](https://github.com/yosuque)! - Approval tokens are now domain-separated from capability tokens cryptographically (design.md decision 63): the approval MAC key is derived from the shared secret under its own label and the MAC input covers the token prefix, and the token prefix is bumped to `kohaku-approval.v2.`. Approval tokens issued by an earlier version (`kohaku-approval.v1.`) are rejected after upgrading; they are short-lived (default TTL 300 s), so an approver only needs to re-issue any approval still pending at the moment of the rollout. Both HMAC ports now type-check every decoded claim and return a denial instead of throwing on a correctly signed but malformed payload.

- [#66](https://github.com/yosuque/kohaku/pull/66) [`9c51dab`](https://github.com/yosuque/kohaku/commit/9c51dab3d986ba1bddc444f8542e41b2e5daa654) Thanks [@yosuque](https://github.com/yosuque)! - `createMemoryApprovalStore` sweeps expired entries at most once per second instead of scanning the whole map on every `consume`; an expired but unswept entry still does not count as consumed, so expiry semantics are unchanged.

### Minor Changes

- [#62](https://github.com/yosuque/kohaku/pull/62) [`cc17b7b`](https://github.com/yosuque/kohaku/commit/cc17b7bc3c96e49b1b74197ac20cd7a3d8ee0b47) Thanks [@yosuque](https://github.com/yosuque)! - Add Governed Actions: Human-In-The-Loop tiers for `DomainPort` write operations (design.md [#62](https://github.com/yosuque/kohaku/issues/62)/[#63](https://github.com/yosuque/kohaku/issues/63)/[#64](https://github.com/yosuque/kohaku/issues/64);
  SPEC §5's ACT-PRM-001/ACT-APR-001/ACT-CNF-001, LIN-ACT-001, §6.2's MCPAPP-ACT-001).
  
  An operation may declare `tier` (`"auto"` (default) / `"confirm"` / `"approve"`) and `paramsSchema`
  (kohaku's own closed JSON Schema subset — `type`, `properties`, `required`,
  `additionalProperties: false`, `enum`, `minimum`/`maximum`, `minLength`/`maxLength`, `items`, `maxItems`,
  `x-message`; deliberately no `pattern`, to avoid both ReDoS and a JS/Python regex-dialect mismatch).
  `spec-core`'s `validateActionParams`/`assertValidActionParamsSchema` (env-neutral, dependency-free, pinned
  byte-for-byte against the Python port via the cross-language golden) enforces the schema before
  `DomainPort.invoke` ever runs, on every write surface alike: REST's `POST /binding/action`, MCP's
  `${prefix}_action`, and the client-side `preflightAction` check `renderer-core` runs before either.
  
  `"approve"`-tier actions are gated by a new stateless, short-lived HMAC-signed `ApprovalPort`
  (`@kohaku-ui/authz-hmac`'s `createHmacApprovalPort`, `"kohaku-approval.v1."`-prefixed tokens, 300s default
  TTL) bound to `(action, payloadHash, requesterId, tenant)`; self-approval is refused at issuance, and a
  verification failure the host cannot classify is treated as a denial (fail-closed). An optional
  `ApprovalStore` adds single-use enforcement. REST gains `POST /approvals` (mints a token as an authorized
  approver, governance kind `action.approve`) and both the REST body and the MCP action tool's input gain
  optional `confirmed`/`approval` fields; a gate failure is `422 ACTION_PARAMS_INVALID` / `403
  APPROVAL_REQUIRED` on REST (with `error.issues`/`error.approval`) and the MCP structured-tool-error
  equivalent.
  
  A compose response optionally carries an **Action manifest** (REST's `actions?` on
  `/compose`/`/events`/`event: spec`; MCP's `_meta["kohaku/actions"]`) mapping each governed action name to
  `{tier, paramsSchema?, confirmMessage?}` — placed outside the `UISpec` itself, next to the capability, so
  it never affects `specHash` or the cache key. `renderer-core`'s `preflightAction` consults it client-side
  before a write round-trip; `renderer-react`/`renderer-wc`/`mcp-renderer` thread `confirm`/`requestApproval`
  hooks through (`renderer-react` ships a `globalThis.confirm`-backed default for the `"confirm"` tier; there
  is no framework-neutral default for `"approve"`, so that tier stays gated until a product wires its own
  hook). `@kohaku-ui/client`/`@kohaku-ui/data-binding` gain typed `ACTION_PARAMS_INVALID`/`APPROVAL_REQUIRED`
  error codes and `confirmed`/`approval` request options. A host that records action outcomes to lineage does
  so under a distinct `action.*` event family (`action.invoked`/`action.denied`/`action.approvalRequested`/
  `action.approved`), carrying `payloadHash` but never the payload's own field values.
  
  The Python port (`python/kohaku`) mirrors the full surface (`kohaku.spec.action_params`,
  `kohaku.host_core.action_gate`/`action_audit`, `POST /approvals`, the MCP action-tool gate), and
  `apps/sample-api` / `python/examples/sales-api` demonstrate both tiers end to end (`annotate`: confirm,
  `publish`: approve) — see the [user guide](../docs/user-guide.md)'s "Governed actions: tiers" section.
  
  **Behavior changes to check when upgrading.** (1) `POST /binding/action` and the MCP action tool now
  reject, before `DomainPort.invoke` runs, any action that is not in the DomainPort's own
  `listOperations()` — previously such an action was invoked ungated. It is rejected with the same response
  as a missing write scope and recorded as `action.denied`. A product whose `listOperations()` omits an
  operation it still expects to be invoked must declare it. (2) `validateActionParams` rejects a payload
  property named `__proto__`, `constructor` or `prototype` at any depth (issue code `unsafeKey`), whatever
  the schema's `additionalProperties` says.

### Minor Changes

- [#32](https://github.com/yosuque/kohaku/pull/32) [`244136c`](https://github.com/yosuque/kohaku/commit/244136c70cb1875c084589c7640ee3fbb3880f4c) Thanks [@yosuque](https://github.com/yosuque)! - Hardens capability revocation and JWT identity resolution, and closes a fail-open gap where a revocation-store
  outage surfaced as an unhandled raw failure instead of a client-safe, observed one.
  
  `@kohaku-ui/authz-hmac`'s `verify` now evaluates the requested scope before consulting the revocation store
  (an out-of-scope request no longer pays for a store round trip), and a store rejection propagates as a thrown
  error rather than being silently swallowed — per `AuthzPort.verify`'s doc comment (`@kohaku-ui/spec-core`'s
  `ports.ts`): verify throws only on infrastructure failure, and a thrown verify is fail-closed, mapped by the
  host to a 5xx. `revokeCapability` now returns `{ ok: true, alreadyExpired: true }` for an already-expired
  token (idempotent success, not a failure) and a coded `"STORE_ERROR"` (instead of throwing) when the
  revocation store itself fails. Expiry is now `exp <= now` consistently across `verify`, `revokeCapability`,
  and the memory store's own sweep (previously `verify`/`revokeCapability` used `exp < now`, off by one second
  at the boundary from the memory store). New `HmacAuthzOptions.requireJti` (default `false`) rejects a
  capability token with no `jti` claim once a fleet has fully rolled onto a `jti`-issuing version.
  
  `@kohaku-ui/authz-jwt`'s `createJwtIdentityResolver` (and `createJwtAuthzPort`, which constructs one) now
  validates its configuration at construction: `audience` is required when `key` is `jwks` or `jwksUrl` (stays
  optional for `secret`); an HS256 `key.secret` must be at least 32 bytes; a `jwksUrl` must use `https:` unless
  the host is `localhost` / `127.0.0.1` / `::1`. New `requireTenant` option (default `false`) rejects a token
  with no (or an empty) tenant claim as `JwtIdentityError({ code: "MISSING_TENANT" })` instead of silently
  widening scope to "no tenant" (only applies to the default claim mapping).
  
  `@kohaku-ui/host-core` adds `verifyCapabilitySafely(authz, token, req, onFailure)` (alongside the existing
  `issueSpecCapabilitySafely`): calls `authz.verify` and returns a discriminated
  `{ kind: "verdict"; verdict } | { kind: "unavailable"; error }` instead of letting a thrown `verify`
  propagate, plus the shared `CAPABILITY_VERIFICATION_UNAVAILABLE_MESSAGE` client-safe text constant.
  `@kohaku-ui/host-rest`'s `/binding/resolve` and `/binding/action`, and `@kohaku-ui/host-mcp-apps`'s
  `kohaku_resolve_binding` / `kohaku_action` tools, now call it and map `"unavailable"` to a client-safe,
  observed failure (REST: 503 `INTERNAL` with `"capability verification unavailable"`, reported to `onError`;
  MCP: a structured tool error with the same message, reported to `onError`) instead of letting a thrown
  `authz.verify` surface as a raw 500 or an unhandled rejection.

- [#28](https://github.com/yosuque/kohaku/pull/28) [`a26f9be`](https://github.com/yosuque/kohaku/commit/a26f9be35f5702287e79f67f13bd3298bfb73bc5) Thanks [@yosuque](https://github.com/yosuque)! - Capability tokens can now be revoked before they expire. `@kohaku-ui/spec-core` adds the
  `CapabilityRevocationStore` port type (`ports.ts`, alongside `AuthzPort`, which itself is unchanged).
  `@kohaku-ui/authz-hmac`'s tokens now carry a `jti`, `createHmacAuthzPort`'s `HmacAuthzOptions` accepts a
  `revocations` store, and the returned `HmacAuthzPort` exposes `revokeCapability(token)` (signature
  verified first, so a caller cannot revoke a `jti` it merely guessed) alongside the reference
  `createMemoryRevocationStore`. A token minted before this change carries no `jti` and verifies as
  before; it simply cannot be revoked and is left to expire on its own, so a rolling deploy does not break
  an older instance's already-issued tokens. `@kohaku-ui/authz-jwt`'s `createJwtAuthzPort` passes
  `revocations` through to the underlying `@kohaku-ui/authz-hmac` port and exposes the same
  `revokeCapability(token)`, delegating entirely; the JWT identity path is unaffected.
  
  `@kohaku-ui/storage-redis` adds `createRedisRevocationStore({ url | client, keyPrefix, connectTimeoutMs,
  maxRetriesPerRequest })`: a revoked `jti` is a plain key carrying its own `SET … EX` expiry derived from
  the token's `exp`, so Redis drops it once the token would have expired anyway (`revoke()` is a no-op when
  that remaining lifetime is already zero or negative); `isRevoked` is an `EXISTS` check. Same fail-fast
  construction and memoized-and-discarded-on-failure `ready()` gate as `createRedisStoragePort`, awaited by
  every method. `@kohaku-ui/storage-postgres` adds `createPostgresRevocationStore({ connectionString | pool,
  schema, migrate })` and a fifth table, `kohaku_capability_revocation` (`jti` primary key, `expires_at`),
  in the shared idempotent `postgresSchemaSql`; `revoke()` upserts, `isRevoked` filters by `expires_at >
  now()`, and `sweepExpiredRevocations()` deletes expired rows for a cron, the same treatment as the
  existing `sweepExpiredSpecCache()`. Both stores are exercised against a real backend via
  `describeRevocationStoreContract` (`@kohaku-ui/port-contracts`), skipping without Docker.

They are reference implementations of `StoragePort` / `AuthzPort` (the contract stays in `@kohaku-ui/spec-core`) and pass the shared contract suites in the private `@kohaku-ui/port-contracts`.

### Patch Changes

- [#28](https://github.com/yosuque/kohaku/pull/28) [`ad51284`](https://github.com/yosuque/kohaku/commit/ad5128464169d389e0c462c59184d411ba359d8e) Thanks [@yosuque](https://github.com/yosuque)! - `DEFAULT_CAPABILITY_TTL_SECONDS` (600) is now defined once in `@kohaku-ui/spec-core`, next to `AuthzPort`. `@kohaku-ui/host-core` and `@kohaku-ui/authz-hmac` re-export the same binding instead of each keeping an independent copy, so the three packages can no longer drift out of sync. No behavior change.

- [#32](https://github.com/yosuque/kohaku/pull/32) [`cffc1aa`](https://github.com/yosuque/kohaku/commit/cffc1aac259bfdc8f22c48ae57427a809853924e) Thanks [@yosuque](https://github.com/yosuque)! - Consolidates several StoragePort/AuthzPort idioms that had drifted into per-adapter copies (code review
  findings). `@kohaku-ui/spec-core` adds `normalizeTenant(tenant)` (an empty-string tenant is now always
  equivalent to an unspecified one — the single normalization every StoragePort tenant parameter should use
  before keying or filtering), the lineage-filter primitives `matchesLineageFilter`, `applyLineageLimit`,
  `DEFAULT_LINEAGE_LIMIT` (= 200), and `LINEAGE_PAYLOAD_INDEX_FIELDS`, the `RevokeCapabilityResult` type
  (next to `CapabilityRevocationStore`, now carrying a machine-readable `code`), and the `SchemaSuggestion` /
  `SuggestedDraft` / `SuggestedEvent` wire types (the single definition for what were three independently
  hand-maintained, structurally-identical copies in `@kohaku-ui/lineage`, `@kohaku-ui/evals`, and
  `@kohaku-ui/client`).
  
  `@kohaku-ui/storage-memory`'s `createMemoryStoragePort` / `createFileStoragePort` now use these shared
  helpers instead of their own copies, and `appendLineage` is idempotent by `id` (a duplicate-id append is a
  no-op instead of creating a second entry). `@kohaku-ui/lineage`'s `SchemaSuggestion` / `SuggestedEvent` and
  `@kohaku-ui/evals`' `SchemaExtractionResult` / `SuggestedDraft` are now type aliases of spec-core's
  definitions (no behavior change). `@kohaku-ui/client`'s `SchemaSuggestionView` / `SuggestedEventView` are
  likewise aliases. `@kohaku-ui/authz-hmac`'s `RevokeCapabilityResult` is re-exported from spec-core, and
  `revokeCapability`'s `{ ok: false, reason }` branches now also carry a `code` (`MALFORMED` /
  `INVALID_SIGNATURE` / `NO_JTI`); `verify`'s own result shape is unchanged.
